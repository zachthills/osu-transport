## Personal Summary

Born in Kansas City and raised in Overland Park, KS, I chose to pursue an undergraduate education in science and technology at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. I began college as a policy debater and learning about carbon driven climate change motivated me to pursue clean energy technology.  My education has explored the air pollution problem and many different research driven ideas for a solution. I am motivated to promote nuclear technology and strengthening the US nuclear engineering community. 

I joined RTRP and the nuclear engineering community at Oregon State in late 2017. Since July 2019, I finished my coursework for my MS and I have been spending my third year of Nuclear Engineering graduate education at Idaho National Lab building a computational research project.

## Research Experience

2014: University of Kansas Department of Mathematics: Climate change data modeling

2015-2016: University of Kansas Department of Molecular Biosciences: Enzymology related to siderophore biosynthesis

2017-2020: Oregon State University Department of Nuclear Engineering: Software engineering for reactor physics analysis

## Research Interests

Innovation in computational power and next generation reactor simulation tools will quicken the design process for new reactors to make it through the political, regulatory and financial difficulties. Idaho National Lab is the national leader for nuclear energy research and has been a great fit for my career interests. 

Currently, I am working in the Reactor Physics group under the advisement of Dr. Mark DeHart at INL. We are developing a MOOSE animal that facilitates I/O linkage necessary to synchronize Monte Carlo tools and BISON fuel performance simulations.
